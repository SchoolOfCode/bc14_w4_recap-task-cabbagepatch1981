# Recap Tasks - Testing 🧪 and getting ready for React ⚛️

## Solidify your testing knowledge 🔎

### Task 1: Write your own Codewars! ⚔️

You've spent the past few weeks solving katas on CodeWars, and you might think that they're written by an elite cabal of software geniuses (or not if you've run across a few less-than-stellar katas!). Not so - they're written by ordinary programmers, and you're now officially School of Code-qualified to join in and give writing your own a try. It's a great opportunity to practice your unit testing with Jest as well. 🧪

👉 [Click here](https://classroom.github.com/a/NUJnoKcZ) for the link to this task. This way, you can share the separate repo with your fellow bootcampers so they can try out your kata.

### Task 2: End-to-end test with Playwright 📜

👉 First, have a play with the app itself in the [task-2 folder](./task-2/). You can run the app locally with `npm i` to install dependencies and then `npm run start` (keep this running during the end-to-end tests). Install and set up Playwright (https://playwright.dev/docs/intro). Write a test which covers the following user flow:

- User navigates to the URL where the app is running
- User types a username/name into the "Name" input
- Input should now contain the name they've entered
- User types a tweet into the "Tweet" text area
- Text area should now contain the tweet they've entered
- User clicks on the "Send tweet!" button
- Both the input and text area should have been cleared, and a new entry should have been added to the list

## Get ready for React ⚛️

We'll be diving into React next week, so it will be beneficial to do some reading and watching so you can be ready to hit the ground running. The following links and videos will walk you through the basics of what React is, why we'd want to use it, and what's happening under the hood.

You don't need to memorize all the details or learn it all by heart! This is your first exposure so you'll have a foundation for when we cover these concepts together.
